# Church Planner

A modern, intuitive church planning application that helps organize Sunday church services and enables ministries to collaborate efficiently. Our goal is to create a more user-friendly alternative to Planning Center Services with an improved UI/UX experience.

## Features

- **Song Library**: Maintain a comprehensive database of worship songs with lyrics, chord charts, and arrangements.
- **Multi-Service Support**: Easily manage multiple services with different schedules, teams, and content.
- **Team Communication**: Built-in messaging and notification system to keep everyone informed.
- **Rehearsal Tools**: Schedule and manage rehearsals, including attendance tracking and resource sharing.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Access your plans from any device with a responsive, mobile-first interface.
- **Custom Reporting**: Generate reports on service elements, volunteer participation, and song usage.

## UI/UX Philosophy

Our application prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, uncluttered interfaces that focus on the task at hand.
2. **Efficiency**: Minimize clicks and streamline workflows for common tasks.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is usable by everyone, regardless of technical ability.
4. **Consistency**: Maintain a cohesive design language throughout the application.
5. **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback for user actions and system status.
