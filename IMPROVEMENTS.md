## Implementation Timeline

Our approach to delivering these improvements follows a phased rollout:

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core service planning, basic volunteer management, and song library

3. **Phase 3**: Smart automation, analytics, and integration ecosystem
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced customization, offline capabilities, and enterprise features

Each phase will involve extensive user testing with actual church staff and volunteers to ensure we're meeting real needs rather than just adding features.

# Custom Event Types Implementation Plan

## Overview
Currently, the Church Planner application supports only four fixed event types: 'service', 'rehearsal', 'meeting', and 'youth'. This implementation plan outlines how to extend the application to support custom event types defined by users.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Create a new `EventType` model in the server with fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `name`: Display name for the event type
  - `code`: Unique code/slug for the event type (used in API and code)
  - `color`: Color code for visual representation
  - `icon`: Optional icon identifier
  - `churchId`: Reference to the church that created this event type
  - `isDefault`: Boolean indicating if this is a system default type
  - `createdBy`: User who created the event type
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Timestamps

- Update the `Event` model to reference the `EventType` model instead of using an enum

### 2. Server-Side Implementation
- Create CRUD API endpoints for event types:
  - `GET /api/event-types`: List all event types for a church
  - `POST /api/event-types`: Create a new event type
  - `GET /api/event-types/:id`: Get a specific event type
  - `PUT /api/event-types/:id`: Update an event type
  - `DELETE /api/event-types/:id`: Delete an event type (with validation to prevent deletion of types in use)

- Create controller functions for these endpoints
- Implement middleware for validation
- Add seed data for default event types
- Update event controller to work with the new event type references

### 3. Client-Side Implementation
- Create new TypeScript interfaces for event types
- Implement event type service with API integration
- Create a new "Event Types" management page in the admin section
- Build UI components:
  - Event type list view
  - Event type creation/edit form with color picker
  - Confirmation dialog for deletion

- Update existing components:
  - Modify event creation/edit form to load event types dynamically
  - Update calendar display to use dynamic colors from event types
  - Enhance event filtering to work with custom types

### 4. Migration Strategy
- Create a migration script to:
  - Create default event types in the database
  - Update existing events to reference the new event type records
  - Handle edge cases and data validation

### 5. UI/UX Considerations
- Design intuitive color selection interface
- Implement preview functionality for event appearance
- Add drag-and-drop reordering of event types
- Create visual indicators for event types in calendar and lists
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios for selected colors

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for event type model and controllers
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for new UI elements
- End-to-end tests for event type management workflow
- Migration script testing with sample data

## Technical Challenges
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing events
- Ensuring color accessibility for user-selected colors
- Handling references to deleted event types
- Optimizing database queries with the additional join/lookup

## Rollout Plan
1. Implement database schema and server-side changes
2. Create migration script and test thoroughly
3. Implement client-side changes with feature flag
4. Run migration in staging environment
5. Test thoroughly in staging
6. Deploy to production with feature initially hidden
7. Enable feature for a subset of users
8. Monitor for issues and gather feedback
9. Roll out to all users

## Future Enhancements
- Event type templates for different church types
- Event type grouping/categorization
- Advanced permissions for event type management
- Analytics on event type usage
- Import/export of event type configurations
