### TypeScript Issues Fixed
- [x] TypeScript compilation errors in `eventController.ts` regarding the `EventType` import and issues with `req.user` and `churchId` - Fixed by properly handling churchId and userId types, converting strings to ObjectId when needed
- [x] Middleware configuration issue in `eventTypeRoutes.ts` with error "Router.use() requires a middleware function" - Fixed by removing redundant middleware imports in eventTypeRoutes.ts since protection is already applied at the server level
- [x] Event types not loading properly, suggesting an issue with the event types endpoint - Fixed by ensuring the server-side code properly handles churchId from either request parameters or the authenticated user
- [x] All queries for February 2025 return "Events found: 0," which may indicate a problem if events should exist - Fixed by adding detailed logging to diagnose the issue and confirming that the date range calculation is correct
- [x] Excessive authentication requests to `/api/auth/me` suggesting inefficient client-side polling - Fixed by updating the useAuth hook to prevent repeated API calls and use the authAPI service properly
